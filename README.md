# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Description:
This is my first game using JavaScript. I used `alert()` `prompt()` and `confirm()` methods to create it. It could've been better with visuals on the page instead of pop-up alerts however, the main concept wouldn't been using only these 3 methods.

## How to Play:
- Click the `START` button,
- Follow navigation descriptions,
- Enter "r" for Rock, "p" for Paper, "s" for Scissors,
- Whoever reaches 10 first, wins.
